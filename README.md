Information  
-----------
This is a simple spacecraft simulator with planets and more.  
I would like you to see the shadows on the Saturn and its ring.  
It was so difficult for practicing webgl.  
Pay attention that your spacecraft might be affected by the gravity and might get much velocity as swing-by.
