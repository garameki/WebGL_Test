## Information  
This is a simple spacecraft simulator with planets and more.  
I would like you to see the shadows on the Saturn and its ring.  
It was so difficult for practicing webgl.  
Pay attention to only one thing called swing-by by which your spacecraft might be thrown far a way.  
   
## How to play 
Please see ```README.md``` in each version. 
  
## More  
If you might use google chrome on a note-type computer,you would be better to turn off hardware accelaration.  
It might be getting uncontinuously to draw.
